#editor:
- fix editor focus when coming back from a node selection,
in fact, the problem exist as the program start ... we can delete lines before any character is typed,
no matter what .focus() function we call :/

#tests:
- implements css selector
- auto-detect firefox path (regedit?)
- red box of node selector with a flying transparent window (no more as red css border)
- error report on lines got wrong when editing code
- asynchronous test handling: now add async test, var job = wait.forCall(); job.done() (for example)
- http lib: weird network loop on HTTP assertGetRequest failed + weird failure on multiple calls
- jsapi: scroll into view? isVisible for each test?
- try to avoid retrieving always the topmost windows by switching to mousedown and prevent event dispatch
- highlight all nodes, on each action (click, type, screenshot, ...)
- find why keydown/up/press doesn't work on xul:textbox
- network API better with async calls to listener but:
   - call may be mixed in time and appear in wrong order in report
   - unable to retrieve on first launch a macro reference
- HTTP hook API to simulate response of any URL (ie generate dynamic local response for http://www.twitter.com/)
- API to automatically set pref/settings IN JS source code (pref("need_restart",true);\n pref("default_timeout",10000); ... )
- API to define multiple tests alternative in ONE test. (common code + at some place, multiple code which do the same "things")
- execute only selection
- move profile copy to a thread and display info messages


#jetpack:
- some directories in settings
- automatically copy .xpt in remote instance
- read directories and parse package.json in order to generate modules paths
