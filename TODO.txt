- add two options (need UI, code's done): 
  * use an empty profile
  * use specified profile but do a copy before using it (to keep it clean)
- handle anonymous xpath
- implements css selector
- add option to show timestamp for each assert time
- add something : js api and/or config to automatically set some preferences values 
(like browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser=false or browser.rights.3.shown=true)
- keypress actions on elements, check click on xul nodes
- browser js helper
- auto-detect firefox path (regedit?)
- red box of node selector with a flying transparent window (no more as red css border)
- error report on lines got wrong when editing code
- asynchronous test handling
- http lib
- push window info into test code editor and add addition info on windows: 
    isTopMost/current ? first ? last, n-th ? "the only one" ?
  and so improve js api which are used to retrieve "known windows"
- jsapi: scroll into view
- fix editor focus when coming back from a node selection,
in fact, the problem exist as the program start ... we can delete lines before any character is typed,
no matter what .focus() function we call :/
